# coep-rough-set-theory
This includes the Python code for evaluating parameters associated with Rough Set Theory analysis of datasets. The code can currently work on computing the parameters taking all the given conditional attributes at a time and considers datasets with only one decision attribute.
I will continue working on the rough set algorithms for multiple conditional attributes taken 'n' at a time. Please feel free to request pulls and commit if you could contribute in any way.
